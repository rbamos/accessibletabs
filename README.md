A brower extension for Guitar Tabs compatible with screen readers

Draft tab layout: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LL_PO3AappEJjSHOtP2fgp9TLVLrjsdItptMtUA4250/edit#heading=h.enpc1udim8ex

Broad development plan:
1. Setup Chrome extension
2. Find or build a generic framework for holding guitar tabs
3. Build a system for outputing accessible versions of those tabs
4. UltimateGuitar integration
5. Songsterr integration
6. GP5/TG file integration

Start with chord tab support first, then move to note tab support
